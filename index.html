				<h2>A little about me:</h2>
				</br>
				<p>I am Musamatov Nurpeyis and I am 23 years old. Like most of the guys of my generation, I am a fan of anime, sports (MMA and Judo in particular) and comedy (<span>Jimmy Car is very rude, but if you find a better punchliner I will cut off my pinkie.</span>). I am a graduate student at the UNU, majoring in Biophysics.</p>
				</br>
				<h2>My competencies:</h2>
				</br>
				<p>I do speak Russian, English, a little German, Uzbek and Kazakh. I had been teaching biology to 6th grade students at local community school for a year, from 2021 till 2022. In 2023, I spent a year as a lab technician in Center for Advanced Technologies. I am a newbie in programming, but I am a quick learner. I know basics of Python, HTML, CSS, and I know how to google. I am punctual, always positive and familiar with the "concept" of subordination. I love working hard when the job is meaningfull, but also can keep working on boring and routine tasks without complaining. I love using my imagination to find a solutions for a different problems, and share my ideas on different topics with people around me. </p>
